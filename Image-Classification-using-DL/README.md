This is my project on image classification using deep learning as part of #VIPatAINEAI


Image Classification using Deep Learning_VIPatAINEAI.ipynb contains the Dataset creation, Image preproccessing, Training and Prediction codes.

Input_data, templates, application.py and predict.py are used for deployment of the model on localhost using Flask
