This is my project on image classification using deep learning as part of #VIPatAINEAI


Image Classification using Deep Learning_VIPatAINEAI.ipynb contains the Dataset creation, Image preproccessing, Training and Prediction codes.
X.pkl and y.pkl store the image information and targets respectively.
SampleNegativeImage.jpeg and SamplePositiveImage.png are used for Prediction in the python notebook 

Input_data, templates, application.py and predict.py are used for deployment of the model on localhost using Flask
