    "### _About the project_\n",
    "#### The project leverages the basic concepts of Python programming such as variables, data types, loop and conditional statements to develop the game where users can play \"Rock, Paper, and Scissors\" or play \"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Objectives_\n",
    "#### 1. Understand the environment of the Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda 3.\n",
    "#### 2. Using different cells and comments in the notebook to mention explanations of your program and syntaxes.\n",
    "#### 3. Understanding basic data types and lists in Python.\n",
    "#### 4. Working with lists and accessing its elements.\n",
    "#### 5. Taking user inputs and printing them.\n",
    "#### 6. Working on the random library\n",
    "#### 7. Initializing the value of a variable\n",
    "#### 8. Creating loops asking the play the game multiple times unless the user enters Q\n",
    "#### 9. Using conditional operators to play the game with different options in different games.\n"
